1. Introduction
The intersection of gender and religion has played a mutually constitutive[a] role across various cultures throughout history, and Judaism is no exception. Within the expanse of Jewish tradition, the role of gender, particularly framed within the boundaries of Halakhah, or Jewish law, has undergone a continuous process of evolution, interpretation, reinterpretation, and adaptation spanning millennia. Halakhic interpretation has played a major role in shaping, and at the same time being shaped by, gender conventions constitutive[b] of Judaism as it is practiced and understood across all of Judaism’s major streams.[c] To comprehend the nature of the construction of gender, it is crucial to establish an understanding of Halakhah itself. 
Halakhah represents the comprehensive body of Jewish law, encompassing a wide array of religious, ethical, and social guidelines that direct the lives of observant Jews.[1][d][e] Rooted in a combination of biblical commandments (mitzvot), Talmudic interpretations, and subsequent legal writings, Halakhah provides a framework for ethical behavior, ritual practice, and communal life. Furthermore, Halakhah is not a static entity. Rather, it is a living tradition that has continuously evolved over centuries in response to changing circumstances and societal shifts.[2] The interpretative nature of Halakhah is illustrated in the ongoing dialogue and debate among scholars and within communities, where principles are applied and reinterpreted to address contemporary challenges on issues ranging from surrogacy to body tattoos. However, this evolving nature of Halakhah is not universally accepted within Judaism, particularly within the traditional Orthodox movement. While current gender norms in Orthodox Judaism are directly derived from Jewish Halakhah, a re-interpretation through contemporary considerations is necessary to resolve the inherent conflict between lived experience and antiquated roles that define the obligations of Jews in highly static and gender-segregated ways, typified by highly gender-stratified roles.[f]


2. Halakhah, Orthodoxy, and Stagnation
In Orthodox Jewish communities, Halakhah serves as the bedrock of religious life, providing a comprehensive yet stagnant guide for conduct and ritual observance. Traditional Halakhic discourse reflects a system that assigns distinct roles based on a largely gender-binary system, with particular attention to family life, synagogue participation, and communal leadership.[3] The interplay between gender and Halakhah is deeply ingrained in the historical traditions of Judaism, shaping the roles, rights, and responsibilities assigned to men and women from birth to death. Halakhah and rabbinic literature have historically diminished the role of women in religious and public spheres, relegating women to mainly domestic, private functions and creating clear-cut distinctions in the public roles of men and women, as well as ordering private life in highly stratified ways. 
One such prominent distinction is the mechitza, the physical barrier separating women from men in public spaces and extending to the private when men outside the close family circle enter familial areas. Ubiquitous with the Orthodox movement, the mechitza is not just a physical representation of unequal treatment of men and women in religious contexts but a symbolic representation of approaching Judaism and prayer from a purely male perspective.[4] Since prayer functions as central to public and private life in Judaism, limitations on women’s capacities concerning worship and religious spaces function to signal the exclusion of women from public life and the ordering of gendered hierarchies. Orthodox communities uphold traditional interpretations that reinforce gender distinctions, citing these superannuated sources and the authoritative voice of rabbinic leaders as authority for the role and positionality of women. To ensure the persistence of these traditional interpretations, there is a historical tendency in Orthodoxy to censor “problematic” works, with Orthodox scholars frequently covering up and cutting out passages or interpretations that do not fit in with their contemporary worldview.[5] These gender-divided traditions date back to some of the earliest instances of Orthodox Judaism, and yet, in most observant Orthodox spheres, remain generally unchanged. Subsequently, by attempting to retain Halakhic interpretations as an unchanging standard of the past, not as a living corpus, the practices of Orthodox Judaism naturally breed conflict with contemporary lived experience and also provide a rigidity to gender roles that cement the ancient exclusions of women from public [g]life in place, and relegate them to the private. 


3. Orthodox Tradition and Lived Experience
The clash between Orthodox tradition and evolving gender discourse naturally arises as a result of treating Halakhah as a fixed, unchanging guide for Jewish life. Recent decades have witnessed a growing awareness and advocacy for gender equality from both within and external to Jewish communities, which has been met with resistance from Jewish Orthodoxy. For instance, the growth of Jewish feminist movements has been met with staunch opposition from Orthodox circles, with the belief that feminism poses a threat to traditional values.[6] Within Orthodox Judaism, a tension arises between the preservation of tradition and the acknowledgment of changing societal attitudes towards gender roles. However, these issues are further entrenched by the fundamentally male-dominated religious worldview of Orthodox Judaism, from the unchanging nature of religious practices to the linguistics of Halakhah. The Orthodox feminist movement was initially born from the acknowledgment of the problem that Orthodox practices stringently revolved around men; the role of women in religious circles was carved out not as an independent entity but rather co-dependently related to men, lacking any semblance of autonomy.[7] While this acknowledgment of co-definition is true of many feminist movements, it is particularly poignant in this discussion, as gender permeates nearly every aspect of Orthodox Jewish tradition: the aforementioned mechitza, participation in prayers, the customs fulfilled—or not fulfilled—by men and women, and beyond. Accordingly, the seemingly opposite poles of fidelity to deeply entrenched gender-specific traditions and the growing push for gender equality have no shortage of contention across multiple issues.[h]
This form and structure of gender division and the hegemonic male view are further agitated[i] by the patriarchal structure of Halakhah, delineating [j]a fundamentally unequal status of women in traditional religious practice. Women are categorized as having a lesser status than men, and this position is illuminated through fewer liturgical obligations, prohibition from studying sacred texts, and a fundamental lack of power in public (religious) life.[8] This inequitable division of power tipped toward the dominant male hegemony is a potent contributor to turbulence rocking such Orthodox customs, particularly due to the demarcation of roles in public and private spheres in traditional Judaism. Similar to the concept of gender parallelism, traditional Halakhic interpretations create an image of society wherein women are relegated to the private, largely domestic sphere, and men occupy and dominate the public sphere.[9] From women not being counted in a minyan—the traditional number needed to conduct ritual prayer—to being barred from leading prayer services, this relegation thoroughly permeates all aspects of religious life. The tension points in this division are both external and internal, as traditional orthodoxies bump up against liberal and equality doctrines that hold and demand both formal and lived equality for women. Internally, orthodox women within their tradition demand changes to grant meaningful roles and recognition within the tradition for women. Such tensions[k] inherently cause strife with the contemporary understanding of women and men equally sharing the public sphere. In reality, Halakhah strays from the notion of gender parallelism in that the outlined roles of men and women were never prescribed to be different but of equal importance; the outsized treatment of women as inferior dismantles any pretense of gender equality in Orthodoxy.[l] Thus, the question of striking a balance between fidelity to Halakhic principles and accommodating evolving societal norms underscores the ongoing deep tensions within Judaism as it functions in modern society.[m] 


4. Catalysts for Change
The historical desire for change within Judaism has profoundly materialized throughout the last century, particularly through the popularization of the Conservative and Reform movements and the rise of Jewish feminist movements. Distinct from the more traditionalist stance of Orthodox Judaism, these denominations serve as beacons of adaptability, treating Halakhah not as an immutable doctrine but as a living, evolving document responsive to contemporary norms. With American ultra-Orthodox sects continually moving further toward the religious right, these movements emerged as a vital counterbalance on the spectrum of religious observance.[10] Evidenced by the ordination of women as rabbis, the inclusive revision of the liturgical language, and the reevaluation of traditional gender roles, Conservative and Reform Judaism showcase a marked departure from Orthodox practices. The significance of these movements lies in their proactive engagement with modernity, challenging the notion that religious traditions must remain static. Furthermore, within the Orthodox movement itself, conflict has arisen between the mainstream and groups that push for the modern expansion of Orthodoxy[n]. For instance, the Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance (JOFA) is an organization that seeks “to expand the spiritual, ritual, intellectual and political opportunities for women within the framework of Halakhah.”[11] These countermovements’ flexible approaches to Halakhah underscore a fundamental shift in how Jewish communities can interpret and apply religious laws, especially in the context of contemporary gender shifts and dynamics. 
Furthermore, beyond the large scale of resistance in such organizations, individualized forms of agency exerted by Orthodox women are ever-increasing. Beyond an expansion in shared feminist consciousness, the past decades have seen a rise in advanced female religious education and female-led grassroots initiatives expressing concerns with some traditional Orthodox practices.[12] [o]Such case studies illustrate the nature of widespread active resistance taken up against the quiescence of Orthodoxy. As Orthodox Judaism grapples with reconciling tradition and the lived experiences of its adherents, the transformative path paved by these movements becomes a compelling model, illustrating how religious practices can contemporaneously honor tradition and embrace societal evolution while still adhering to Halakhah.


5. A Path Forward for Reinterpretation
In proposing a re-examination of traditional gender norms within Orthodox Judaism, a viable path emerges that seeks to harmonize core religious principles with contemporary perspectives. As studying the intersection between Halakhah and contemporary gender dynamics has grown increasingly relevant, so has an emergent discourse about how such analysis can be adapted[p] in reality. The first issue of practical transformation is that of adapting Halakhah, where many in Orthodox circles argue that the constant changing of core beliefs retracts from Halakhah’s role as both normative and authoritative. However, in this discussion, it is not truly the changing of Halakhah that is at stake, but rather the changing minhag, the manifested customs and behavior of Jewish communities.[13] The variance of minhag has long been a tumultuous, nonhomogeneous notion across geographical and historical contexts but generally traces back to similar core Halakhic principles. Thus, a re-interpretation of Halakhah in this manner functions as a shifting of minhag via Halakhic re-examination rather than a subversion of Halakhah.
The second issue that arises is how to effectively balance the weight of contemporary understanding with ancient customs and precedents. However, this is not only possible in theory but is quite viable and reproducible. One strong example of such is the book Gender Equality and Prayer in Jewish Law, written by Rabbis Ethan Tucker and Micha’el Rosenberg. In it, Tucker and Rosenberg examine two pressing issues in prayer discourse—regarding the participation and leadership of women in prayer—but do so relying only on Halakhic precedent to argue for the full participation of women in traditional services.[14] By rationalizing their arguments a priori in the roots of Halakhic texts and traditions, Tucker and Rosenberg establish a convincing reframing of Jewish practices relating to gender for their target Orthodox audience. While other works in this field frequently analyze and focus on the commentary of modern Reform or Conservative thinkers in building their theses, Tucker and Rosenberg craft their argument in a manner that fortifies existing Halakhah. They expressly shy away from cherry-picking or delegitimizing Halakhic arguments, rather acknowledging that every piece of wisdom is valuable regardless of how widely it was accepted or when it was proposed.[15] In this fashion, their argument is more readily digestible by its intended Orthodox audience and provides concrete, grounded reasoning for why such adaptations are crucial in these communities[q]. Community leaders and scholars play pivotal roles in steering this discourse, guiding the faithful through a thoughtful and informed process of reinterpretation that acknowledges the tradition’s richness while aligning with contemporary values. Through a dynamic re-examination of Halakhic interpretations, Orthodox Judaism can forge a path that honors tradition and accommodates its adherents’ diverse experiences and perspectives in the present day.


6. Conclusion
The exploration of gender relations, structures, and orders within Judaism, particularly in the context of Orthodox tradition, unveils a complex narrative shaped by the evolving nature of Halakhah and the clash[r] between tradition and contemporary lived experiences. Entrenched gender roles within Orthodox Judaism, rooted in historical interpretations that assign distinct roles to cis-gendered men and women, give rise to the inherent tension between modernity and centuries-old customs. The push for change is evident in external movements like Conservative and Reform Judaism, formed in opposition to the stagnancy of Orthodoxy, and internal movements within the Orthodox sphere with organizations such as JOFA. Furthermore, the patriarchal structure of Halakhah and its unequal treatment of women contribute to the ongoing agitation and revision. The proposed path forward involves a careful reinterpretation that balances tradition and contemporary values, carefully navigating the difference between changing Halakhah and changing minhag. 
However, the presence of diversity between sects of Orthodox Judaism is a notable point for further research. From modern Orthodox, a more progressive form of Orthodoxy increasingly popular in the United States, to ultra-Orthodox, the strictest form of Orthodoxy most commonly found in Israel and certain pockets of the United States, there exist discrepancies within the Orthodox movement itself. Prospectively, further research can explore the nuanced dynamics within different branches of Orthodoxy, considering the varying levels of adherence to tradition and the potential for evolving perspectives on gender roles internally. Additionally, the impact of these discussions on the broader Jewish community and the ways in which reinterpretation can foster inclusivity and resilience in the face of societal shifts warrant further exploration. Ultimately, the intersection of gender, religion, and tradition remains a fertile ground for ongoing research and dialogue within the Jewish context and beyond.

[g]I believe the exclusion of women is actually less about Judaism and more about the time and place--Middle Eastern B.C.E. where we see across cultures and religions the marginalization of women (see Mesopotamian societies as early as 3500 BCE and veiling, etc.). However, I just wanted to make it clear that women were not de facto excluded in ancient times.
